4th May 2019 Found long standing error in runOptimise/StudyConfig.
Code that computes covariance taking account of constraint which is active from 20/8/17  computes the cpt
due to constraint incorrectly. Rather than setting cov[-1,-1] to 2*mu covariance is set to 1/(2*mu). This started off in runOptimise
and then propagated into StudyConfig.

The effect of this is to reduce dramatically the impact of the constraint (netflux) on the optimisation.
Fortunately this does not affect any of the optimisation studies used in this paper as they were all run
in June/July 2017. It does affect runs subsequent to that!
